## Features
- **Two-Pass Assembler**: 
  - The first pass checks for syntax errors and creates a label table.
  - The second pass resolves label addressing and generates machine code.
- **Error Handling**: 
  - Detects improper label names, duplicate labels, and other syntax errors.
- **Memory Emulator**: 
  - Executes the generated machine code and produces a memory dump.
- **Normalization**: 
  - Corrects formatting issues in assembly code for better processing.

## The Simple Instruction Set

This instruction set defines operations for a stack-based machine with four registers:
- **A & B**: Act as an internal stack.
- **PC (Program Counter)**: Tracks execution flow.
- **SP (Stack Pointer)**: Manages the stack.

Instructions are **32-bit**, with the **lowest 8 bits as the opcode** and the **upper 24 bits as the operand**. Some instructions **do not require an operand**.

## Files Generated and Compilation Instructions

The assembler generates **three output files**:

- **`.log` file** – Contains error, warning, and info messages.
- **`.lst` file** – Listing file (only generated if no errors are found).
- **`.o` file** – Machine code object file (used as input for the emulator).

### Compilation Instructions

To compile the **Assembler**:
```sh
g++ Assembler.cpp -o assembler
```


## How to Use
1. **Open the Project**: Open the `DLCO_LAB_MINI_PROJEECT` folder in your preferred IDE (e.g., VS Code).
2. **Edit Code**: Write your assembly code in `code.txt`.

3. **Compile the Project**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the `DLCO_LAB_MINI_PROJEECT` directory.
   - Use the following command to compile the project, including all necessary libraries:
     ```bash
     g++ main.cpp libraries/Assembler_lib.cpp libraries/emu_lib.cpp libraries/error_library.cpp libraries/lable_lib.cpp libraries/opcode_lib.cpp libraries/reading_lib.cpp libraries/support_lib.cpp -o assembler
     ```
   - This command compiles `main.cpp` along with all the library files and creates an executable named `assembler`.
4. **Run the Executable**:
   - After successful compilation, run the executable with the following command:
     ```bash
     ./assembler
     ```
   - Choose the run type:
     - Type `-mac` for machine code generation.
     - Type `-emu` for emulation.

## Test Programs
The project includes several test programs located in the `programs` directory:
- **Bubble Sort**: Implements the bubble sort algorithm.
- **Sum of First N**: Calculates the sum of the first N natural numbers.
- **Sum of Array**: Computes the sum of elements in an array.

## Warnings and Errors
- The emulator may produce large memory dumps (up to 200-300 MB).
- Ensure proper formatting of assembly code to avoid errors:
  - Use labels correctly.
  - Avoid using data declarations in incorrect formats.

## Conclusion
The DLCO Lab Mini Project serves as a comprehensive tool for learning assembly language programming, providing both an assembler and an emulator. It is designed for UNIX and Mac systems and is compatible with Xcode version 14.2.
This was my course project for CS2102 DIGITAL LOGIC AND COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE for Prof Jimsom Mathews. 
Unfortunately, I got a mediocre final grade but making this project was a worthy experience.
